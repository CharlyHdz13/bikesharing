# Bike Sharing Analysis
## Overview of the statistical analysis
With the intention of bringing famous Citi bike sharing program to Des Moines, we made an statistical analysis using Tableau as our primary tool to have a deep dive into how this program works and what we should focus on when bringing this to our town.

## Results
Before starting with the written analysis here is the [link to story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/GSN48TXM3?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) which has the Tableau visualizations on the which the written analysis will be based on.

Firstly, we have the total number of rides and how it is distributed between gender. So female users only make up about one fourth of our total number of rides, meanwhile male users are the ones that make more use of the program. It seems the programs suits better male needs than female. Therefore, when implementing it in Des Moines we should first take a look at the male population to have a good estimate of the number of bikes required for the program.

Moving onto the next visualization, _Top Starting Locations_. We have a very good look at NYC and the most amount of rides is highly concentrated in the center of the city. This is pretty obvious because is at the center of the city where people tend to spend most of their day and it is easier to grab a bike for a 5 min trip to somewhere nearby than grabbing a taxi or using public transport. Another benefit of grabbing the bike is the experience of cruising through the city and enjoying it. As we move outwards the number of rides decreases, maybe becasue here it is easier to grab your own car to travel due to the less traffic in the zone. Nevertheless, the numbers in this outer regions is not small either. Something very interesting to take into consideration.

Now, the trip duration of the rides is shown in the next visualization where the peak of our graph is the five minute mark. Further supporting my previous argument that people prefer a five minutes ride through the city than having to use either the subway, their car or taking a taxi.

The next visualization only continues to show the huge difference between the number of rides taken by male users, than female users, but both have a similar trend when it comes to the duration of their trip.

Moving forward a heatmap of the amount of trips divided by day and hour is shown. In this heat map whe have to clear peak hours of the day where the amount of trips increases which is in the morning when the people is going to their workplace and by the end of the day when people have ended their workday. Another clear distintion is made on weekends when the amount of rides is increased throught the whole day. This perhaps is due to people wanting to enjoy their weekend with a trip in a bike throught the city. 

The following visualization, shows the breakdown by gender of the previous heatmap and it shows that both female and male have the same behavior.
