# Bike Sharing Analysis
## Overview of the statistical analysis
With the intention of bringing famous Citi bike sharing program to Des Moines, we made an statistical analysis using Tableau as our primary tool to have a deep dive into how this program works and what we should focus on when bringing this to our town.

## Results
Before starting with the written analysis here is the [link to story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/GSN48TXM3?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) which has the Tableau visualizations on the which the written analysis will be based on.

Firstly, we have the total number of rides and how it is distributed between gender. So female users only make up about one fourth of our total number of rides, meanwhile male users are the ones that make more use of the program. It seems the programs suits better male needs than female. Therefore, when implementing it in Des Moines we should first take a look at the male population to have a good estimate of the number of bikes required for the program.
